            Graduation is
            <em>strange.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since August, I've been
            <b>dreaming</b>
            of leaving Wakeland, of leaving Frisco, of the prospect of "starting fresh" and "moving
            on" (whatever that means) and gaining a whole new host of experiences from a new life in
            a new place—which,
            <u>could not,</u>
            be
            <em>here.</em>
            I fanticised about all the different places that I could be living, studying. I
            researched colleges and programs and thought about the different kind of person I'd be
            as a part of each of them. Aren't we a product of our environments?
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that leaving is only a few days away, I question if I even
            <em>want</em>
            it anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            I focused so much on the future, what could be, that I forgot about the present, what
            is. What's more important? I'm still unsure. It's kicking me now that my friends are
            getting shipped all over the United States. They are leaving this place, and I may not
            see them again—and that's
            <em>strange.</em>
            I'm leaving this place—and that's
            <em>strange.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>All of this</b>
            is
            <em>strange...</em>
            strange, nerve wracking, and endearing at once.
