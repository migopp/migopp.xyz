          Graduation is
          <em>strange.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since August, I've been
          <b>dreaming</b>
          of leaving Wakeland, of leaving Frisco, of the prospect of "starting
          fresh" and "moving on" (whatever that means) and gaining a whole new
          host of experiences from a new life in a new place—which,
          <u>could not,</u>
          be
          <em>here.</em>
          I fanticised about all the different places that I could be living,
          studying. I researched colleges and programs and thought about the
          different kind of person I'd be as a part of each of them. Aren't we a
          product of our environments?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that leaving is only a few days away, I question if I even
          <em>want</em>
          it anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused so much on the future, what could be, that I forgot about
          the present, what is. What's more important? I'm still unsure. It's
          kicking me now that my friends are getting shipped all over the United
          States. They are leaving this place, and I may not see them again—and
          that's
          <em>strange.</em>
          I'm leaving this place—and that's
          <em>strange.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>All of this</b>
          is
          <em>strange...</em>
          strange, nerve wracking, and endearing at once.
