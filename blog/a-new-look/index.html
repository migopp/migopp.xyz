            Over the past few days, I've overhauling this website. If you were a regular here
            before, then I'm sure you'll notice quite the difference. I quite like it. Change is
            good: how else can you grow?
          </p>
          <p>
            As always, this website was built completely by me with plain 'ol HTML and CSS. At this
            point, I haven't really attempted to integrate anything else (although some scripts not
            be out of the question in the future). It may not be the fanciest thing ever, but at
            least it's authentic. I didn't just follow some step-by-step YouTube tutorial to build
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if this was a complete overhaul, it took less time to complete than when I
            developed it the first time ~5 months ago. Which—I mean—is to be expected, but is also a
            sign of growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not purely a visual change, though, this update also serves to add mobile
            fucntionality to my home on the web. Good news—this means you can read my blogposts from
            <em>anywhere!</em> Even your
            <a href="/blog/a-new-look/nest-hub/" class="in-text-link">Nest Hub</a>
            (whatever that is)!
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I do think that this rendition is organized more cleanly as well (on account of me
            not being a complete noob), so expansion should be relatively painless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, that's all for now. I move into my dorm in Austin on the 16th, so expect a new
            post around then. In case you're especially interested, I've hidden a clue concerning
            its topic somewhere in this page.
