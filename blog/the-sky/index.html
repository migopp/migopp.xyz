          <p>We aren't really strangers, are we? Far from it.</p>

            And yet—in this last embrace, I question whether it was ever a possibility. After all,
            this universe and all matter within has collapsed to the state of our current reality.
            Inherently, the life that we now live holds no more weight than the neighboring reality.
            The crossing of our paths in the way that we know it was only one of an infinite
            possibilities: all identically probabilistic in nature.
          </p>
          <p>But I question what it all means.</p>

            I'll always look back on this time with a heartwarming nostalgia; my eyes opened. For
            being the best friends one could hope to have, I owe you no less than the sky and
            everything therein. Because—you have gifted me the ability to
            <em>truly</em>
            see it.

            This blogpost was not planned ahead of time. The clue in the post
            <a href="/blog/a-new-look/" class="in-text-link">A New Look</a>
            did not hint towards the release of these thoughts. Rather, it pertains to the blogpost
            immediately following this one, which is still scheduled to release later this week.
