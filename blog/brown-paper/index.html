            In a tour of my room, you'd see a side of myself I hide from nobody. Prototype
            electroscopes, a (surprisingly-constructionally-sound) cardboard chair
            <a href="#note-1" id="sup-1"><sup>1</sup></a
            >, two whiteboards, countless math books—you get the jist.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, my favorite decorations are taped to the walls: hand-crafted posters of my favorite
            math problems, all made with brown paper. They're an homage to
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" class="in-text-link"
              >Numberphile</a
            >
            <a href="#note-2" id="sup-2"><sup>2</sup></a
            >, a YouTube channel comporised of mini-documentaries about famous problems and
            mathematicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that—in and of itself—is
            <em>not</em>
            what makes them special to me, though; rather, it's the message of passion, of
            perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creator of the channel—Brady Haran—isn't a mathematician, though. He's a journalist.
            As such, his perspective is wholly different; he carries a different vibe throughout his
            videos. Each one is carefully (yet, authentically) crafted by math-lovers
            <a href="#note-3" id="sup-3"><sup>3</sup></a
            >, for math-lovers. Touring the world, Haran interviews the most passionate
            mathematicians. He introduces the humanity behind the numbers: a conglomeration of lived
            experiences—a bridge between those who solved the problems and those who admire the
            beauty of the proof.

            So, my brown papers represent some of my stories. Math is the subject at the core of my
            ambitions: a vehicle for everything that I love. These papers mean much more than the
            numbers scrawled on them with sharpie; they share me, my experiences, my ambitions.

                This was made for an project in my Intro to Engineering Design class in 10th grade.
                And, it was actually the project that made me realize engineering was not for me.
                It's really a funny story, but it's also too long to detail here.

                I attribute my growing love of mathematics to this channel—along with 3Blue1Brown,
                blackpenredpen, and my wonderful first-year Geometry teacher Mrs. Keith. Without
                these people, I feel like it would've taken a lot longer to discover it.
