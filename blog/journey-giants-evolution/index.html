            I wrote my first line of code in my second year of high school. Yeah—I started late, I
            know.

                They emphasize the connection between us and the greats: Turing, Hopper, Dijkstra.
                Throughout my studies, I can only hope to carry this mentality with me; to pursue
                the ever-breathing knowledge of those who came before. Throughout high school,
                exploration and a desire for deeper understanding have supplied me with a more
                nuanced view of computer science as a whole. I've come to see it as more than a mere
                tool for application, but as a beautiful subject in its own right—centered on the
                art of efficiency.

                Within, there's a warm sense of gratitude. These words convey a sense of respect
                that is due from all learners; after all, we all gained our ability to access new
                information from someone. In many cases, it's our professors, our teachers, our
                mentors—but it could just as easily be the person who wrote the textbook, published
                their information on that website, or made the YouTube video. We all build upon
                others' accomplishments, forging progress: a reminder of just how tall we are when
                we stand together.

            I see the strength and interdisciplinary beauty of computer science—a field that pushes
            knowledge far beyond computing and programming alone. It's possible to create realistic
            lighting in a video game with knowledge of optical physics, and machine learning
            functions on the basis of multivariable calculus. In college, I'm excited to explore
            these connections and use them to pioneer new, innovative solutions.

                Yes, I know that Newton was likely making fun of Hooke's ostensibly short stature
                (as my Physics C teacher, Mrs. Watson, once gave a half-hour lecture over). And as a
                short-ish guy myself, I probably ought to be a little upset by the second-hand burn
                factor. Somehow though, I can't help but admire the fact that Newton simultaneously
                roasted a rival while delivering one of the most beautiful and meaningful lines ever
                written. The man was a genius: as if that wasn't already apparent by his invention
                of Calculus.

                Somehow, I find the sentiment quite endearing. "The Eyes of Texas" played on the
                Carillion is cute—I can't wait to hear it on campus.
