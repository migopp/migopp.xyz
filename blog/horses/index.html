          <p>It's true‚Äîpreposterous, but true. All horses are the same color.</p>
          <h2>Argument</h2>
          <p>
            For a population of 1 horse, we can say for certain that it has the same color as
            itself. Assume that any group of
            <em>n</em> horses all have the same color, where <em>n</em> is an arbitrary positive
            integer <a href="#note-1" id="sup-1"><sup>1</sup></a
            >. Now, consider a population of <em>n</em> + 1 horses.
          </p>
          <img src="/blog/horses/images/horses.png" class="banner" />
          <p>
            We can split the
            <em>n</em> + 1 horses into two groups, the first <em>n</em> horses, and the last
            <em>n</em>
            horses‚Äîas shown below:
          </p>
          <img src="/blog/horses/images/horses-first-n.png" class="banner" />
          <img src="/blog/horses/images/horses-last-n.png" class="banner" />
          <p>
            In either case, we know that each set contains all of the same color because of our
            assumption <a href="#note-2" id="sup-2"><sup>2</sup></a
            >. Since the first horse is the same color as the middle horses, and the last horse is
            the same color as the middle horses, the first and last horses must be the same
            color‚Äîand, of course, must share the same color as the middle horses. So, all
            <em>n</em> + 1 horses are the same color. So, the existence of a group of
            <em>n</em> horses of the same color implies that a group of <em>n</em> + 1 horses will
            have the same color. So, any amount of horses will have the same color. All horses have
            the same color, if you will. QED, proof done‚Äîshown beyond a reasonable doubt.
          </p>
          <p>Right?</p>
        </section>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Fallacy</h2>
          <p>
            Of course not. I lied. We know that not
            <em>all</em> horses are the same color. There are white horses, brown horses, grey
            horses, and pink <a href="#note-3" id="sup-3"><sup>3</sup></a> horses: among many other
            kinds.
          </p>
          <p>So, how is our argument flawed?</p>
          <p>
            The underlying method of proving this bologna assertion is actually a valid way of
            proving properties for
            <em>all</em> objects with assumed shared characteristics. It's called induction. The
            idea is that, if you can prove a property holds for one object (called verifying the
            base case), and that the veracity holds while adding another object (the inductive
            step), you can prove that statement for <em>all</em> of the objects‚Äîbecause, you could
            continue repeating the inductive step forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            The assumption is also not flawed. This is a crucial part of induction, but if you have
            proven the base case to be truthful, then the arbitrary
            <em>n</em> could be chosen as that base case. In that situation, you are simply proving
            that the base case implies the following one. It's nothing extraordinary, though it
            seems to be on the outset.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, our proof works for
            <em>almost</em> all <em>n</em>. All, but a single value. For the value <em>n</em> + 1 =
            2, (or, more simply <em>n</em> = 1), the inductive step does not work because there
            <em>are no</em> middle horses to compare the starting and ending horses to. In this
            case, not considering everything on the small scale hindered our ability to recognize
            dissonance on the large scale. In fact, the truly vital case was not the case where
            there was one horse, but the case where there <em>became</em> multiple of them. That is
            truly the shift that deserves special attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's easy (in the way that I've presented this proof) to be
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3E5CKebKuQ&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare"
              class="in-text-link"
              >‚Äúmisled by the ellipsis‚Äù</a
            >
            as Albert Meyer put it. We assume that the small scales to the large, so we need not
            consider it. We assumed that proving it for
            <em>all</em> horses required of thinking large, thinking of the case where there are a
            lot of them and they ought to differ from each other somehow. We assumed a lot of horses
            were behind the three dots; however, as we've seen, the vital case is‚Äîperhaps
            perplexingly‚Äîthe inverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, as you've seen, with a little trick, something absurd can seem true. Such is the
            case with many fallacious arguments, so being able to break everything down and
            understand each component is of the utmost importance.

            This blogpost was released a few days later than I expected for it to be; I thought that
            I would have plenty of time to finish between the time I moved in and when college
            started. However, it went a bit differently than I expected, to say the least.

            I have spent the past few days meeting some wonderful people in Turing, and trying to
            get to know each one of them. I've had some great experiences already, like meetups with
            '27 meetups with Christopher in GDC 5.302, a mysterious tour of the CS sever room
            <a href="#note-4" id="sup-4"><sup>4</sup></a> three-hour meals in Kins, morning walks to
            Target, and midnight climbing of the MechE building for a closer look at the night sky.
            I couldn't have been any more grateful to be a part of Turing. Even if the classes in
            the next couple years are incredibly difficult and rigorous, we have each other, and
            maybe that's enough. As of today, I'm Gone To Texas: Hook 'Em. ü§ò
