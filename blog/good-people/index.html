        <p>What does it mean to be a "good" person?</p>
        <p>
          I'm sure many people would argue that certain traits (such as
          compassion, selflessness, or intelligence) make a person "good," but
          is it really that simple?
        </p>
        <p>
          At the basis of the answer, one must confront what goodness means as a
          concept, and extend it to what it even means <em>to be</em> a person.
          Is goodness just moral virtuousness—maybe even just the absence of
          evilness? Or, is it more broad than that?
        </p>
        <section class="goodness">
          <h2>"Goodness"</h2>
          <p>
            Consider the possibility that the idea of "goodness," when applied
            to "good people," is similar to the idea of "goodness" applied to
            being a "good cook," "good electrician," or "good runner." Behind
            all of these descriptions, there is a purpose—chefs cook, so a
            "good" chef cooks well, producing high quality food that they (or
            people in general) can enjoy; electricians fix wiring and stuff, so,
            naturally, a "good" electrician fixes with expertise and efficiency;
            runners—well—run, so a "good" runner runs well, breaking records,
            winning races, clocking fast times. This logic continues for most
            descriptions of "good" things; they do their jobs well.

            Building off of our new consideration, it would follow that "good
            people" do the job of being a person well. But what is the job of a
            person?
          </p>
          <p>A person... <em>lives?</em></p>
          <p>
            Isn't that a deeply personal question? Then, determining the
            requirements for being a good person presupposes that we have
            collectively decided what the purpose of being a person is—<em
              >but have we? Can we even do that?</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Without them, we can't reasonably determine our profieciency in
            executing this task of being human. So, is this even a valuable
            metric anyway? Maybe not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does everyone have the same purpose? Maybe not—and, maybe, whether
            or not someone is a "good" person all depends on purpose. Perhaps
            there are many, and we all lay at the fork of an infinitely
            diverging path. And, further, consider that our traditional notion
            of "good" people builds itself upon the idea of being virtuous and
            moral—coinciding with the purpose of living for others, of
            collectivism. Is it possible, then, that being a "good" person as a
            concept is simply a derivative of being "good" at anything?

          <h2>Toasters and Concessions</h2>
          <p>
            All of these ideas are fun to think about, but they break down
            fairly easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, consider a hypothetical person who believes it is their
            life mission and sole purpose to go to random swimming pools and
            throw toasters into them—electrocuting innocent people. If they were
            to carry this out well, then, technically, they would be a "good"
            person by the standards set above. They achieve their purpose as a
            person well. Who are we to tell them that the belief of their
            purpose is not their purpose?
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope it's easy to see that when you view "goodness" this way, it
            quickly becomes meaniningless.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, morality is also individualistic; there's no objectivity, only
            different schools of thought. So, the morality that is inherently
            implied when we call a person "good" is also dependent on that
            context. If this toaster-thrower lived in a hypothetical society
            where this electrocution was considered moral, their actions would
            constitute that of a "good" person's. Yet again, this devolves
            because people could, theoretically, pick an arbitrary moral code to
            justify any action as "good."
          </p>
          <p>I wonder if there is any satisfying answer.</p>
