                    Recently, a certain bit of prose struck me as particularly elegant and
                    meaningful. So, I wanted to write about it here; it's from Maggie Smith's poem, "Good Bones"—
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blog-quote">
                    "I am trying
                    to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
                    walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
                    about good bones:
                    <b>This place could be beautiful,
                        right? You could make this place beautiful.</b>
                    "
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    You should absolutely read the poem in its entirety
                    <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones" class="para-link">
                        here
                    </a>
                    (if you can).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core, I believe "Good Bones" is
                    <em>
                        the
                    </em>
                    story of wrestling with the world we inhabit—of facing the philosophical argument of life's
                    meaning and making something beautiful from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of the text, Smith confides in us; she shares her quarrels with the world that her
                    children are growing up in, and how she tries to "keep" it all from them. But, there is a
                    prodding at the back of the reader's mind—why? I'm sure many of us can agree that introducing
                    children to shortness of life, the discomfort of death, and the world's "at least half terrible"
                    nature, ruining the child's innocence, is not a good deed: and yet, we still wonder why
                    <em>
                        she
                    </em>
                    does it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It culimates in the prose that I've put above—it's why she hides the truth about the world from her
                    children. It's out of a sentiment of hope, not fear. After all, if her children became too
                    overwhelmed by the establishment, would they have the courage to try and fix it? Maybe not. Does
                    this type of thinking justify the dishonesty? Maybe—it's a philosophical question but, suffice it to
                    say, it's very real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smith's work is not just about the relationship bridging parent and child, though. This is about
                    the relationship between our generation and the next as a whole. This is about the relationship
                    between us and the generation before. Is this the meaning Smith searches for at the outset? Maybe
                    this is why life is worth the trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rhetorical question posed is hesitant, as if Smith is looking for validation. It reveals a level
                    of humanity and questioning that illuminates the wavering human nature of uncertainty. Smith is
                    unsure of the morality of her actions, but she has the sort of hope that can't be extinguished. The
                    final direct address only strengthens her resolve, illustrating that the author has come to a
                    conclusion—
                    <em>
                        you
                    </em>
                    could make a change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This poem is not directed at Smith's children, it's directed at us. And, somehow, that gives it all
                    the more meaning—it's an elegant idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are only here for a short time, why give up? Humanity is a giant family, and we live to
                    push each other onward.
                    <em>
                        We
                    </em>
                    could make this place
                    beautiful.
