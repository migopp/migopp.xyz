            Recently, a certain bit of prose struck me as particularly elegant and meaningful. So, I
            wanted to write about it here; it's from Maggie Smith's poem, "Good Bones"—
          </p>
          <p class="emphasized-block">
            "I am trying to sell them the world. Any decent realtor, walking you through a real
            shithole, chirps on about good bones: This place could be beautiful, right? You could
            make this place beautiful."
          </p>
          <p>
            You should absolutely read the poem in its entirety
            <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones" class="in-text-link"
              >here</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core, I believe "Good Bones" is
            <em>the</em>
            story of wrestling with the world we inhabit—of facing the philosophical argument of
            life's meaning and making something beautiful from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of the text, Smith confides in us; she shares her quarrels with the world
            that her children are growing up in, and how she tries to "keep" it all from them. But,
            there is a prodding at the back of the reader's mind—why? I'm sure many of us can agree
            that introducing children to shortness of life, the discomfort of death, and the world's
            "at least half terrible" nature, ruining the child's innocence, is not a good deed: and
            yet, we still wonder why
            <em>she</em>
            does it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It culimates in the prose that I've put above—it's why she hides the truth about the
            world from her children. It's out of a sentiment of hope, not fear. After all, if her
            children became too overwhelmed by the establishment, would they have the courage to try
            and fix it? Maybe not. Does this type of thinking justify the dishonesty? Maybe—it's a
            philosophical question but, suffice it to say, it's very real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smith's work is not just about the relationship bridging parent and child, though. This
            is about the relationship between our generation and the next—between those of the past
            and
            <em>us</em>. Is this the meaning Smith searches for at the outset? Maybe this is why
            life is worth the trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rhetorical question posed is hesitant, as if Smith is looking for validation. It
            reveals a level of humanity and questioning that illuminates the wavering human nature
            of uncertainty. Smith is unsure of the morality of her actions, but she has the sort of
            hope that can't be extinguished. The final direct address only strengthens her resolve,
            illustrating that the author has come to a conclusion—
            <em>you</em>
            could make a change.
          </p>
          <p>
            This poem is not directed at Smith's children, it's directed at us. And, somehow, that
            gives it all the more meaning—it's an elegant idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are only here for a short time, why give up? Maybe, we could live to push each other
            forward.
            <em>We</em>
            could make this place beautiful.
