        <h2>City Pop and Interstate Driving</h2>
        <p>
          I've been on a

          Jason sent me a few Anri albums a while ago, and I mean, yeah, she's
          great and I love her music. But, there's something especially
          refreshing about rolling down the window—barrelling down the
          interstate, toward the future, with the slick, nostalgic jazz beat
          humming through my ears. My arm stuck out and wrapped up onto the
          roof; the conglomeration of (what can only be described as)
          <a

          pervaded my half of the car. It was in this peculiar state that I
          vibed out to
          <em>Timely!!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn't have wanted it any other way, though. In any case, city pop
          isn't why I'm writing this.

        <h2>The Big Bang</h2>

            <p>
              Last weekend, I visited UT Austin for >goto_Turing, and it was
              pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Friday morning, we drove into Austin from Jonestown (where my aunt
              and uncle live), and stayed in a hotel on the east side of I-35.
              Suffice it to say, it took all but five minutes—we arrived at the
              hotel, and, almost instantly, I asked my dad to take me to UT. I
              got in
              <span class="note-hi">
                a little bit of nerdy pregaming

                >
              </span>
              , so it was a nice slow-paced day before goto.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it was a great weekend filled with lots of great
              memories—morning walks down Speedway,
              <span class="note-hi">

              Taking the time to slow down and enjoy the moment is something
              that I've cherished through this experience. After all, it's the
              beginning of a big shift in my life; I've lived in Frisco for
              eighteen years and this place, these people—it's all brand new.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to say Austin is my home for the next four years, and
              I'm sure I'll look back from the future and think of all the great
              opportunities and friendships that started at goto.

                Annie and I watched a guest lecture over "Hardware-aware
                Algorithms for Efficient Machine Learning" which was pretty
                cool. Not that I really know enough about hardware, algorithms,
                or machine learning to get all that much out of it. It did spike
                an interest to learn more about it, though.

                The veggie burger was a special kind of gross. It just looked
                like the rotten Krabby Patty from Spongebob, and I actually had
                a couple people send that gif as a response.
