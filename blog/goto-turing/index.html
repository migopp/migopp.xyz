            <h2>City Pop and Interstate Driving</h2>
            <p>
              I've been on a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_pop" class="in-text-link">city pop</a>
              craze recently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jason sent me a few Anri albums a while ago, and I mean, yeah, she's great and I love
              her music. But, there's something especially refreshing about rolling down the
              window—barrelling down the interstate, toward the future, with the slick, nostalgic
              jazz beat humming through my ears. My arm stuck out and wrapped up onto the roof; the
              conglomeration of (what can only be described as) truck smell and a melting chocolate
              Payday bar
              <a href="#note-1" id="sup-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
              pervaded my half of the car. It was in this peculiar state that I vibed out to
              <em>Timely!!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              I wouldn't have wanted it any other way, though. In any case, city pop isn't why I'm
              writing this.

            <img src="/blog/goto-turing/images/goto-banner.png" class="banner" />
            <p>Last weekend, I visited UT Austin for >goto_Turing, and it was pretty cool.</p>
            <p>
              Friday morning, we drove into Austin from Jonestown (where my aunt and uncle live),
              and stayed in a hotel on the east side of I-35. Suffice it to say, it took all but
              five minutes—we arrived at the hotel, and, almost instantly, I asked my dad to take me
              to UT. I got in a little bit of nerdy pregaming
              <a href="#note-2" id="sup-2"><sup>2</sup></a
              >, so it was a nice slow-paced day before goto.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it was a great weekend filled with lots of great memories—morning walks down
              Speedway, interesting faculty lectures
              <a href="#note-3" id="sup-3"><sup>3</sup></a
              >, dining at Jester and bonding over the bad food
              <a href="#note-4" id="sup-4"><sup>4</sup></a
              >, throwing gutterballs in the Union basement... I could go on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taking the time to slow down and enjoy the moment is something that I've cherished
              through this experience. After all, it's the beginning of a big shift in my life; I've
              lived in Frisco for eighteen years and this place, these people—it's all brand new.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to say Austin is my home for the next four years, and I'm sure I'll look
              back from the future and think of all the great opportunities and friendships that
              started at goto.

                Yes, these exist. They are amazing—a better version of Reese's, for sure.

                Annie and I watched a guest lecture over "Hardware-aware Algorithms for Efficient
                Machine Learning" which was pretty cool. Not that I really know enough about
                hardware, algorithms, or machine learning to get all that much out of it. It did
                spike an interest to learn more about it, though.

                Many of which went straight over my head.

                The veggie burger was a special kind of gross. It just looked like the rotten Krabby
                Patty from Spongebob, and I actually had a couple people send that gif as a
                response.
