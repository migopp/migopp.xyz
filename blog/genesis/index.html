            Last night—or, I guess, really early this morning—around midnight, this website came
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not going to act like I know what I'm doing here, or what I was doing at my desk
            last night: Ghibli Café Jazz blasting, a nearly empty Gatorade bottle next to Mac Miller
            <a href="#note-1" id="sup-1"><sup>1</sup></a
            >, hands gripping my hair. To be honest, I've never really made something like this, and
            there's quite a learning curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, I've definitely come out of this project with a better grasp on web development;
            and, there's something about wanting to implement a feature and creating your own unique
            solution that's intensely satisfying. As you may, or may not, be able to tell, I was
            going for the
            <a
              href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/radio-nerd-shenanigans/"
              class="in-text-link"
              >MIT Blog</a
            >
            <a href="#note-2" id="sup-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
            aesthetic with this site—and I quite like it. If you go looking, you may find some
            quirky similarities, or you might not: depends on how hard you try.
          </p>
          <p>
            [This site has since been updated, and it no longer bears any resemblence to the MIT
            blog. Not that it
            <em>really</em>
            ever did...]
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, this website's source code is all available on
            <a href="https://github.com/migopp" class="in-text-link">my GitHub</a>
            <a href="#note-3" id="sup-3"><sup>3</sup></a
            >, and it's hosted using Netlify. I spent lots of time last night trying to learn the
            basics of hosting, but it's all a little complicated; my only real education on internet
            function is from AP CSP (which is bare-bones to put it lightly), so I've got my work cut
            out for me. I've only ever done this kind of work when I published a site to house a
            reverse-engineered Tetris clone, but even then I didn't
            <em>really</em>
            <a href="#note-4" id="sup-4"><sup>4</sup></a>
            understand what I was doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now's the time to learn, then. I don't really understand why you need a certificate for
            your website to have "https://" in the URL, what that entails, or what exactly any of it
            means—but, I'll figure it out. That's what building this site was for. It's a
            playground, a starting point.

                Funnily enough, I didn't even apply to college here. Maybe I'll tell that story
                another time.

                I have no idea what I'm doing with this either. If I put something idiotic on a repo
                there, I'm sorry.

                No, I don't think mindlessly following the steps of a YouTube tutorial counts.
