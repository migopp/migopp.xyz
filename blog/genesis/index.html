          Last night—or, I guess, really early this morning—around midnight,
          this website came online.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not going to act like I know what I'm doing here, or what I was
          doing at my desk last night: Ghibli Café Jazz blasting, a nearly empty
          Gatorade bottle next to

          , hands gripping my hair. To be honest, I've never really made
          something like this, and there's quite a learning curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, I've definitely come out of this project with a better grasp on
          web development; and, there's something about wanting to implement a
          feature and creating your own unique solution that's intensely
          satisfying. As you may, or may not, be able to tell, I was going for
          the
          <span class="note-hi">
            <a
              href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/radio-nerd-shenanigans/"

          aesthetic with this site—and I quite like it. If you go looking, you
          may find some quirky similarities, or you might not: depends on how
          hard you try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, this website's source code is all available on my

          <span class="note-hi">

              ><sup>03</sup></a
            >
          </span>
          , and it's hosted using Netlify. I spent lots of time last night
          trying to learn the basics of hosting, but it's all a little
          complicated; my only real education on internet function is from AP
          CSP (which is bare-bones to put it lightly), so I've got my work cut
          out for me. I've only ever done this kind of work when I published a
          site to house a reverse-engineered Tetris clone, but even then I
          didn't

          understand what I was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now's the time to learn, then. I don't really understand why you need
          a certificate for your website to have "https://" in the URL, what
          that entails, or what exactly any of it means—but, I'll figure it out.
          That's what building this site was for. It's a playground, a starting
          point.

                Funnily enough, I didn't even apply to college here. Maybe I'll
                tell that story another time.

                I have no idea what I'm doing with this either. If I put
