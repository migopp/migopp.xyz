          In a tour of my room, you'd see a side of myself I hide from nobody.
          Prototype electroscopes,

          , two whiteboards, countless math books—you get the jist.

        <p>
          But, my favorite decorations are taped to the walls: hand-crafted
          posters of my favorite math problems, all made with brown paper.
          They're an homage to
          <span class="note-hi">

          , a YouTube channel comporised of mini-documentaries about famous
          problems and mathematicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's
          <em>not</em>
          what makes them special to me, though; rather, it's the message of
          passion, of perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator of the channel—Brady Haran—isn't a mathematician, though.
          He's a journalist. As such, his perspective is wholly different; he
          carries a different vibe throughout his videos. Each one is carefully
          (yet, authentically) crafted by
          <span class="note-hi">
            math-lovers
            <a href="#fn3" class="fnref-link" id="annotation-3"
              ><sup>03</sup></a
            >
          </span>
          , for math-lovers. Touring the world, Haran interviews the most
          passionate mathematicians. He introduces the humanity behind the
          numbers: a conglomeration of lived experiences—a bridge between those
          who solved the problems and those who admire the beauty of the proof.

          So, my brown papers represent some of my stories. Math is the subject
          at the core of my ambitions: a vehicle for everything that I love.
          These papers mean much more than the numbers scrawled on them with
          sharpie; they share me, my experiences, my ambitions.

                This was made for an project in my Intro to Engineering Design
                class in 10th grade. And, it was actually the project that made
                me realize engineering was not for me. It's really a funny
                story, but it's also too long to detail here.

                I attribute my growing love of mathematics to this channel—along
                with 3Blue1Brown, blackpenredpen, and my wonderful first-year
                Geometry teacher Mrs. Keith. Without these people, I feel like
                it would've taken a lot longer to discover it.
