                In a tour of my room, you'd see a side of myself I hide from nobody. Prototype electroscopes, a
                (surprisingly-constructionally-sound) cardboard chair, two whiteboards, countless math books—you get
                the jist.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, my favorite decorations are taped to the walls: hand-crafted posters of my favorite math problems,
                all made with brown paper. They're an homage to
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" class="para-link">Numberphile</a>,
                a YouTube channel comporised of mini-documentaries about famous problems and mathematicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's
                <em>not</em>
                what makes them special to me, though; rather, it's the message of passion, of perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creator of the channel—Brady Haran—isn't a mathematician, though. He's a journalist. As such, his
                perspective is wholly different; he carries a different vibe throughout his videos. Each one is
                carefully (yet, authentically) crafted by math-lovers, for math-lovers. Touring the world, Haran
                interviews the most passionate mathematicians. He introduces the humanity behind the numbers: a
                conglomeration of lived experiences—a bridge between those who solved the problems and those
                who admire the beauty of the proof.
            </p>

                So, my brown papers represent some of my stories. Math is the subject at the core of my ambitions: a
                vehicle for everything that I love. These papers mean much more than the numbers scrawled on them with
                sharpie; they share me, my experiences, my ambitions.
