        <p>
          I would love to show you my work on this project and the code I wrote for it. I'm
          obviously proud of it; after all, I'm choosing to publish the fact that I did it here.
          However, this project is an essential part of a course that I took (or am taking) at UT
          Austin. So, publishing my code would leak my professors' assignments and may entice others
          to copy my work rather than using the opportunity to learn for themselves.
