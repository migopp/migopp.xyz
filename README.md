# Michael Goppert's Website
This is the GitHub repository for my personal website (<https://migopp.xyz>). It's a pretty bare-bones construction, I knowâ€”just a fairly simple series of HTML/CSS webpages.

As I become more advanced in the ways of web development, so too will this website grow. This is only a starting point.
