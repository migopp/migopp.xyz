# Michael Goppert's Website
This is the GitHub repository for my personal home on the Internet (<https://migopp.xyz>).

It's developed entirely by me with plain 'ol HTML and CSSâ€”no scripts as of now. It's currently in its second rendition, and I only plan on expanding on it from here. As my skills grow, it shall grow too.
