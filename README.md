# Michael Goppert's Website
This ~~is~~ was the GitHub repository for my personal home on the Internet (<https://migopp.xyz>). My updated website is in a new repo, which you can find [here](https://github.com/migopp/migopp.dev).

This was developed entirely by me with plain 'ol HTML and CSSâ€”no scripts as of now. It's currently in its second rendition ~~, and I only plan on expanding on it from here~~. As my skills grow, it shall grow too.
