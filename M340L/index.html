        <p>
          Here's a few notes that I took in the last half of linear algebra.
          Maybe they will prove useful to you. All of these were notes from my
          studies with Dr. Kravchenko at UT Austin from M 340L. The core text
          was
          <em>Introduction to Linear Algebra</em> by the legend Gilbert Strang
          himself.

          This is not meant to be anything too fancy. I also just wanted to mess
          around with MathJax and Pandoc.
