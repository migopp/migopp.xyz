        <p>
          Here's a few notes that I took in the last half of linear algebra.
          Maybe they will prove useful to you. All of these are from my studies
          with Dr. Kravchenko at UT Austin from M 340L: Matrices and Matrix
          Calculations. The core text was
          <em>Introduction to Linear Algebra</em> by the legend Gil Strang.

          This is not meant to be anything too fancy. I also just wanted to mess
          around with MathJax and Pandoc.
