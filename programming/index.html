            <h2>On The Journey, Giants, and Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                I wrote my first line of code in my second year of high school. Yeah—I started late, I know.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, I believe I stand—as do all students in UTCS and Turing—"on the shoulders of
                <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people" class="para__link">Giants</a>."
                <a href="#fn1" class="fnref__link" id="fnref1"><sup>01</sup></a>
                These words, while most famously remembered as Newton's
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants" class="para__link">diss</a>
                on Hooke, really resonate with me for a few reasons.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        They emphasize the connection between us, the lowly undergrads, and the greats:
                        Turing, Hopper, Dijkstra. Throughout my studies, I can only hope to carry this mentality with
                        me;
                        to pursue the ever-breathing knowledge of those who came before. Throughout high school,
                        exploration and a desire for deeper understanding have supplied me with a more nuanced view of
                        computer science as a whole. I've come to see it as more than a mere tool for application, but
                        as a beautiful subject in its own right—centered on the art of efficiency.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Within, theres a warm sense of gratitude. These words convey a sense of respect that is due from
                        all learners; after all, we all gained our ability to access new information from someone. In
                        many cases, it's our professors, our teachers, our mentors—but it could just as easily be the
                        person who wrote the textbook, published their information on that website, or made the YouTube
                        video. We all build upon others' accomplishments, forging progress: a reminder of just how
                        tall we are when we stand together.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I see the strength and interdisciplinary beauty of computer science—a field that pushes
                knowledge far beyond computing and programming alone. It's possible to create realistic lighting
                in a video game with knowledge of optical physics, and machine learning functions on the basis
                of multivariable calculus. In college, I'm excited to explore these connections and use them to
                pioneer new, innovative solutions.
            </p>

                So, my true journey through computer science starts

                                Yes, I know that Newton was likely making fun of Hooke's ostensibly short stature (as my
                                Physics C teacher, Mrs. Watson, once gave a half-hour lecture over). And as a short-ish
                                guy
                                myself, I probably ought to be a little upset by the second-hand burn factor. Somehow
                                though, I can't help but admire the fact that Newton simultaneously roasted a rival
                                while
                                delivering one of the most beautiful and meaningful lines ever written. The man was a
                                genius: as if that wasn't already apparent by his invention of Calculus.

                                Somehow, I find the sentiment quite endearing. "The Eyes of Texas" played on the
                                Carillion is cute—I can't wait to hear it on campus.
